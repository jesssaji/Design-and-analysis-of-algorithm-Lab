1. Time Space Trade off Implementation
a. Let S be an integer array of n elements perform two operations
  remove(i)-I is removed from S
  next(i)- returns the next larger element j, where j&gt;i, jÎµ S, if such j exists.
Implement the same using linked list.

b. Make observations on the two methods and comment on time-space tradeoff.
